# Device_HW
Project meant to be ran on hardware (STM32F446) to read device data/translations and transmit it to PC GUI application through U(S)ART)

This is a STM32Cube project that includes the Device_DEV libraries for the STM32F446 nucleo board. The libraries can be configured to be included or excluded, the software should be configured to the connected devices and their required components. The main goal is to use as little and as much as possible memory so the constantly loaded while meeting timing constraints.
